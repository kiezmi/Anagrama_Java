# Description of the repository:

## The function of the app is to write a word and find all the anagrams of that word given in a dictionary (the anagram must also be part of the dictionary).

## The dictionary is a simple text file that contains one word per line.

## The program should handle anagram requests as quickly as possible. Consider pre-processing the dictionary to optimize the requests.
